## Who I am
I'm a geologist that enjoys solving problems using code, mostly with Python. I have bachelors and masters degrees in geology and geological engineering from Colorado School of Mines. In my current job, I'm an oil and gas development geologist in the Permian Basin of New Mexico. I work every day with engineers, petrophysicists, geophysicists, landmen, and data scientists to figure out how to optimally develop oil and gas fields. Oil and gas is a high-tech, data intensive industry, and I have found learning to work with code to solve problems in this field to be very rewarding.

I created this site to demonstrate some of what I've learned and to share with other geologists some useful applications of Python. If you are interested in learning some of these skills, be sure to checkout my [Resources Page](/resources/).
