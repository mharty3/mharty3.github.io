# Welcome to my blog!
My goal for this site is to demonstrate how Python can be used by geologists. I plan to share one or two posts a month to demonstrate a workflow I find useful or to discuss a topic related to geology and programming. I expect some posts will be longer and more detailed and serve as sort of a portfolio of side projects I work on while others will be shorter "code snippets." Code snippets will be short bits of code that carry out tasks I don't perform often enough to have the syntax memorized. I usually turn to Google to lookup the exact code. Having a collection of these snippets in one place will be a useful reference for me. Maybe it will be helpful to others too.

If you are enjoying the blog (or not) and want to reach out for a discussion or share ideas, you can find me on [the software underground](https://softwareunderground.org/) or send me a message on Twitter [@michaelharty3](https://twitter.com/MichaelHarty3).

Be sure to checkout my [Resources Page](/resources/) to see some of my recommended resources for learning and applying Python.
